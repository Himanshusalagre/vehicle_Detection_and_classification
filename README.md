 #Real Time Detection and Classification of Vehicles Using Haar Cascade Classifier 

Computer Vision Plays a vital role in traffic management and surveillance systems 
and has been an active research area in the past years. In systems like these, the 
detection of vehicles and also classification of the vehicle plays a major role. 
The datasets are traffic videos of urban environment taken from various cities around 
the world which were used to train the classifier hence generating a robust classifier. 

This System has the following Haar Cascades:
1) Haar Cascade for Car detection
2) Haar Cascade for Bus Detection
3) Haar Cascade for Two-Wheeler Detection


Steps To Run The Project

System Requirements:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) Python 3.6 Or above

2) Opencv-python -> Python 3.4+ comes with an easy installation tool called pip to install additional packages. 
(package manager) 
      
     
Successfull installation of above packages may be checked by moving into python shell and typing "import cv2"
If nothing shows up then installation was successful.
.
We had used python 3.6.1 but any version higher than 3.6.1 will also do.
